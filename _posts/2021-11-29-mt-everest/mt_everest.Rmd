# Dataset
I got two datasets, peak ascents and deaths reports for Everest from [The Himalayan Database](https://www.himalayandatabase.com/index.html){target="_blank"} and combined them into one dataset. Most other online databases only provide one or two recent year data for free, and I didn't find more available data, so this dataset has limited variables for analysis. Probably could add some weather data like daily wind speed and average temperature as predictors. ðŸ‘‰[National Geographic](https://www.nationalgeographic.org/projects/perpetual-planet/everest/weather-data/){target="_blank"}

something is wrong here, NA is more than 215, and the totals are not equal?

```{r}
NA_cnt <- table(is.na(total))
NA_pct <- prop.table(NA_cnt)
cbind(NA_cnt, NA_pct)

total <- VIM::kNN(total, 
                  variable = c("Age", "Oxy"),
                  k = 10)
total <- total[, -c(15:16)]
table(is.na(total))

counts <- table(total$Dth)
proportions <- prop.table(counts)
cbind(counts, proportions)
```

# Plots

::: panelset
::: panel
[Age]{.panel-name} Male climbers' age range is wider than females due to some outliers. We can see the oldest climbers are over 80. 50% of death in females are between the age of 30-50 while males are between 30-45. Both genders' interquartile ranges are similar among success ascents groups. 

```{r plot1}
ggplot(data = total, 
       mapping = aes(x = Sex,
                     y = Age,
                     fill = Dth), na.rm = TRUE) +
  labs(x = "Sex",
       y = "Age",
       title = "Age Distribution by Sex and Death",
       tag = "Fig. 1") +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = .3)
```
:::

::: panel
[Causes]{.panel-name} More people died the altitude below 7500m because of natural disasters compared to the altitude above 7500m. Death zone^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_zone] is defined as an altitude above 8000m, which can cause mountaineers to lose physical strength or even vital functions due to a low level of concentration of oxygen. I guess I could add some ratio variables for the death rates in different altitude zones? Like death zone and Khumbu Icefall?

![](000001.png) =(Had issues with some columns even though I had already removed the missing values and it did work when I ran the chunk individually. However, it did not work when I knit the whole post. ðŸ˜©
